    "text": "Abatement of debts and legacies is a common law doctrine of wills that holds that when the equitable assets of a deceased person are not sufficient to satisfy fully all the creditors, their debts must abate proportionately, and they must accept a dividend.\n\nIn the case of legacies when the funds or assets out of which they are payable are not sufficient to pay them in full, the legacies abate in proportion, unless there is a priority given specially to any particular legacy. Annuities are also subject to the same rule as general legacies.\n\nThe order of abatement is usually:\n Intestate property\n The residuary of the estate\n General Devises—i.e., cash gifts\n Demonstrative Devises—i.e., cash gifts from a specific account, stocks, bonds, securities, etc.\n Specific Devises—i.e., specified items of personal property, real property, etc.\nNon-probate property—i.e., life insurance policies—do not abate.\n\nDefinitions\nA specific devise, is a specific gift in a will to a specific person other than an amount of money. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving his $500,000 yacht to his brother Mike, the yacht would be a specific devise.\n\nA general devise, is a monetary gift to a specific person to be satisfied out of the overall estate. For example, if James's will states that he is leaving $500,000 to his son Sam then the money would be a general devise.\n\nA demonstrative devise, is money given from a particular account.  For example, \"$10,000 to be paid from the sale of my GM stock.\"\n\nA residual devise is one left to a devisee after all specific and general devices have been made.  For example, James's will might say: \"I give all the rest, residue and remainder of my estate to my daughter Lilly.\" Lilly would be the residual devisee and entitled to James's residuary estate.\n\nReferences\n\nCommon law\nWills and trusts"

Exact figures range from 95% copper and 5% zinc to “8 parts copper to 1 of zinc” (11% zinc) in British Army Dress Regulations.\n\nGilding metal is used for various purposes, including the jackets of bullets, driving bands on some artillery shells, as well as enameled badges and other jewellery. The sheet is widely used for craft metalworking by hammer working. It is also used particularly as a lower-cost training material for silversmiths.  Starting in 1944, shell casings made of gilding metal were melted down by the United States Mint to be made into pennies.  These pennies replaced the less popular steel cent of 1943, and the pennies of this composition were produced until 1946.\n\nGilding metal was also used for the \"bronze\" Olympic medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in 2021.\n\nGilding metal may be annealed by heating to between .

Common types include:\n\n Step/snap termination – these occur when a flake snaps or breaks during removal, resulting in an abrupt right-angle break.\n Hinge termination – results when the applied force rolls away from the core or objective piece, creating a rounded or blunted distal end.\n Overshot/outrepasse/plunging termination - occurs when the applied force dips and removes a section of the opposite margin of the artifact or the distal end of the core.  Also referred to as a reverse hinge termination.\n Perverse termination - \"twisting\" breaks resulting from when the applied force is redirected through the material in a helical fashion;\n Feather/monotomic termination – a smooth termination that results in a feathered distal end.  The distal ends of these flakes are only a few molecules thick, are extremely sharp, and indicate a flawless detachment.  These are the intended results of some lithic reduction techniques, and are very desirable for opportunistic tool use that does not require retouching or sharpening.\n\nReferences\n Andrefsky, William, Jr. (1998) Lithics: Macroscopic approaches to analysis.

Pelagius became Pope Benedict I's successor on November 26, 579, without imperial confirmation.\n\nPelagius appealed for help from Emperor Maurice against the Lombards, but to no avail, forcing Pelagius to \"buy\" a truce and turn to the Franks, who invaded Italy, but left after being bribed by the Lombards.\n\nPelagius labored to promote clerical celibacy, and he issued stringent regulations on this matter. During his pontificate, the bishop of Milan, who had broken communion with Rome in the Schism of the Three Chapters, returned to full communion around 581, while other bishops in Northern Italy remained in schism.\n\nPelagius ordered the construction of the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, a church shrine over the place where Saint Lawrence was martyred. During his reign, the Visigoths of Spain converted, but he also faced conflict with the See of Constantinople over the adoption of the title of \"Ecumenical Patriarch,\" which Pelagius believed to undermine the authority of the papacy.\n\nPelagius fell victim to the plague that devastated Rome at the end of 590. His successor, Gregory I, thought his regulations of clerical celibacy too strict, and modified them to some extent.\n\nReferences\n\n590 deaths\nPopes\nItalian popes\n6th-century deaths from plague (disease)\nPopes of the Byzantine Papacy\n6th-century archbishops\nYear of birth unknown\n520 births\n6th-century popes\nInfectious disease deaths in Lazio"

    "text": "In computer networking and telecommunications, route flapping occurs when a router alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another, or as unavailable and then available again, in quick sequence. \n\nRoute flapping is caused by pathological conditions (hardware errors, software errors, configuration errors, intermittent errors in communications links, unreliable connections, etc.) within the network which cause certain reachability information to be repeatedly advertised and withdrawn. For example, link flap occurs when an interface on a router has a hardware failure that causes the router to announce it alternately as \"up\" and \"down\".\n\nIn networks with link-state routing protocols, route flapping will force frequent recalculation of the topology by all participating routers. In networks with distance-vector routing protocols, route flapping can trigger routing updates with every state change. In both cases, it prevents the network from converging.\n\nRoute flapping can be contained to a smaller area of the network if route aggregation is used. As an aggregate route will not be withdrawn as long as at least one of the aggregated subnets is still valid, a flapping route that is part of an aggregate will not disturb the routers that receive the aggregate.\n\nSee also\n BGP route damping\n Supernet\n\nReferences\n\nFlapping"

She had an image (simulacrum) in the Forum, and her cultus, as Festus notes, spread from there throughout the neighborhoods (vici) of the city.\n\nThe original statue was set up by an Aurelius Cotta who had supervised the installation of new pavement in the Forum at the end of the 80s BC. The goddess's purpose was to safeguard the stonework from fire damage. Only the Lares Augusti outnumber her as recipients of surviving dedications from compital shrines.\n\nIn the neighborhoods\n\nThe cult of Stata Mater was centered on compital shrines of the vici, and numerous inscriptions to her were made by the heads of neighborhood associations (vicomagistri). Her popularity attests to the everpresent threat and danger of fire in metropolitan Rome. She is sometimes given the additional title Augusta, perhaps in reference to the reorganization of the regions of Rome under Augustus in 7 BC. One of the outcomes of this redistricting was to create local boards or neighborhood watches (vigiles) tasked with fire control, as a response to recent arson in the Forum. The dedications mark the success of local fire brigades in putting out fires. One pairs Stata Mater Augusta with Volcanus Quietus Augustus, \"the 'Quieted' Vulcan Augustus.\" Stata Mater is perhaps to be identified with the Fortuna Augusta Stata named in an inscription. Her cultivation is an example of localized Imperial cult under Augustus.\n\nA Vicus Statae Matris (\"Stata Mater's Neighborhood\") was located on the Caelian Hill, and a Vicus Statae Siccianae in the Transtiberim.\n\nW.H. Roscher places Stata mater among the indigitamenta, the list of deities maintained by Roman priests to assure that the correct divinity was invoked for rituals.\n\nSee also\n Vulcanalia\n Vesta\n Cacus\n Great Fire of Rome\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n A pedestal for Stata Mater from Roman Spain\n\nFire goddesses\nRoman goddesses"

It is made by taking baked flat bread (made of durum wheat flour, salt, yeast, and water), then separating it into two sheets which are baked again. The recipe is very ancient and was conceived for shepherds, who used to stay far from home for months at a time: pane carasau can last up to one year if it is kept dry. The bread can be eaten either dry or wet (with water, wine, or sauces). A similar, yeast-free bread, with added seasoning, is known as  \"dripped bread\".\n\nRemains of the bread were found in archeological excavations of nuraghes (traditional Sardinian stone buildings) and it was therefore already eaten on the island prior to 1000 BC.\n\nReferences\n\nExternal links\n A video showing the production of Pane carasau\n History of Pane Carasau\n\nItalian breads\nFlatbreads\nCuisine of Sardinia\nAncient dishes"

As of 1 January 2015, its population is 4731, down from 5008 in January 2005. It received city rights in 1237. Before 1 January 2003, Oostburg was also the name of a municipality. It merged with Sluis-Aardenburg to form the new municipality of Sluis. The municipality covered an area of 224.93 km², of which 1.05 km² was water. As well as the town of Oostburg, the former municipality also included the following towns, villages and townships:\nBreskens\nCadzand\nGroede\nHoofdplaat\nIJzendijke\nNieuwvliet\nSchoondijke\nWaterlandkerkje\nZuidzande\n\nOostburg is typically a tourist town very close to the beaches at Cadzand. Every Wednesday is market day all year round but in the summer the town is busy and has many fun events.\n\nThe unicorn\nOostburg's symbol is the unicorn, from which the townsfolk are said to derive strength and courage. In reality, the unicorn's presence is represented by a sculpture produced by the sculptress Liesbeth Messer-Heijbroek who for many years, with her husband, lived in the area: she evidently took inspiration from the name of a former inn. The sculpture has been repositioned at least once since it first appeared in 1952 during the postwar reconstruction: at one stage it adorned a small car park. Currently it shares with a modern fountain a spot in \"Eenhoornplantsoen\" (Unicorn Place) beyond the northern end of the old market square in the town centre.\n\nWW2 Monument\nDuring the Second World War approximately 140 Oostburg townsfolk died and most of all the buildings, shops and churches were destroyed. This monument is a tribute to them and the rebuilding of the town. Around the lower part of the monument are the names of those who perished.\n\nCities in the Netherlands\nMunicipalities of the Netherlands disestablished in 2003\nPopulated places in Zeeland\nFormer municipalities of Zeeland\nSluis"

    "text": "\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is a term for the name of a song sung by The White Knight from Lewis Carroll's  1871 novel Through the Looking-Glass, chapter VIII.\n\n\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is an example used to elaborate on the symbolic status of the concept of \"name\": a name as identification marker may be assigned to anything, including another name, thus introducing different levels of symbolization. It has been discussed in several works on logic and philosophy.\n\nNaming\n\nThe White Knight explains to Alice a confusing nomenclature for the song.\n\nTo summarize:\n\nThe song's name is called Haddocks' Eyes\nThe song's name is The Aged Aged Man\nThe song is called Ways and Means\nThe song is A-sitting on a Gate\n\nThe complicated terminology distinguishing between 'the song, what the song is called, the name of the song, and what the name of the song is called' both uses and mentions the use–mention distinction.\n\nThe song\n\nThe White Knight sings the song to a tune he claims as his own invention, but which Alice recognises as \"I give thee all, I can no more\". By the time Alice heard it, she was already tired of poetry.\n\nThe song parodies the plot, but not the style or metre, of \"Resolution and Independence\" by William Wordsworth.\n\nUpon the Lonely Moor\n\nLike \"Jabberwocky,\" another poem published in Through the Looking Glass, \"Haddocks’ Eyes\" appears to have been revised over the course of many years. In 1856, Carroll published the following poem anonymously under the name Upon the Lonely Moor. It bears an obvious resemblance to \"Haddocks' Eyes.\"\n\nSee also\n\nNonsense verse\n\nReferences\n\nBritish poems\n1871 poems\nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland\nNonsense poetry\nParodies of literature"
