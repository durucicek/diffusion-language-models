This entry intersects with other mythological entities such as Amarok, which represents the spirit of the wolf.\n\n### Animal Deities in Inuit Mythology\n\nInuit pantheon includes deities associated with various animals, reflecting the cultural and ecological significance of these creatures in their traditional way of life. Among these, Amaguq stands out as a trickster and a wolf god, embodying both the cunning and the ferocity often attributed to wolves.\n\n### Mythological Canines\n\nCanines, particularly wolves, hold a prominent place in mythological narratives across cultures. In Inuit mythology, Amaguq's role as a wolf god underscores the reverence and perhaps fear that wolves inspired among the indigenous peoples of the Arctic regions.\n\n### Trickster Gods\n\nAmaguq's classification as a trickster god aligns with a common archetype found in many mythologies. Trickster figures often challenge societal norms, engage in mischief, and sometimes provide moral lessons through their actions. This duality—both mischievous and wise—characterizes Amaguq's role within Inuit mythology.\n\n### Wolves in Folklore, Religion, and Mythology\n\nThe presence of wolves in various mythologies highlights their importance as symbols of strength, wilderness, and sometimes malevolence. From Norse mythology to Native American traditions, wolves are frequently depicted in stories that explore themes of nature, survival, and the human-wildlife relationship. Amaguq's association with wolves places him within this broader context of mythological representations of these majestic creatures.\n\nThis overview provides a structured examination of Amaguq's role in Inuit mythology, situating him within the broader framework of animal deities, trickster figures, and the cultural significance of wolves in various mythological traditions.",

Exact figures range from 95% copper and 5% zinc to “8 parts copper to 1 of zinc” (11% zinc) in British Army Dress Regulations.\n\nGilding metal is used for various purposes, including the jackets of bullets, driving bands on some artillery shells, as well as enameled badges and other jewellery. The sheet is widely used for craft metalworking by hammer working. It is also used particularly as a lower-cost training material for silversmiths.  Starting in 1944, shell casings made of gilding metal were melted down by the United States Mint to be made into pennies.  These pennies replaced the less popular steel cent of 1943, and the pennies of this composition were produced until 1946.\n\nGilding metal was also used for the \"bronze\" Olympic medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics held in Tokyo, Japan in 2021.\n\nGilding metal may be annealed by heating to between .

For example, it covers the outside of bullets, helps hold artillery shells together, and makes colorful badges and jewelry. People who make crafts often use it too. It's also used to teach people how to work with silver because it costs less.\n\nDuring World War II, the United States made pennies from gilding metal. They did this because they needed copper for other things. These pennies were used from 1944 to 1946.\n\nIn 2021, during the Tokyo Olympics, medals were made partly from gilding metal.\n\nTo make gilding metal easier to shape, it needs to be heated to about 600 to 700 degrees Fahrenheit. After shaping, it should cool slowly to avoid breaking.\n\nReferences:\n\nCopper alloys\nBrass\nAmmunition",

          "text": "Gilding metal is a type of brass, which is a mixture of copper and zinc. It has a lot more copper than zinc—usually around 95% copper and 5% zinc, or sometimes about 11% zinc, depending on the specific mix.\n\nThis special kind of brass is used in many different ways. For example, it's often used to make the outer layer of bullets, called jackets. It can also be used for the bands that wrap around some big artillery shells. Gilding metal is also great for making colorful badges and jewelry because it can be painted or coated easily. Craftsmen like to work with it too, using hammers to shape it into different forms.\n\nDuring World War II, the U.S. government found a clever way to reuse old ammunition. They melted down bullet casings made of gilding metal and turned them into pennies. This helped save money and resources. The pennies made from this metal were used instead of the steel pennies that were used in 1943. These new pennies stayed in circulation until 1946.\n\nFor the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, they even used gilding metal to make the bronze medals!\n\nTo keep gilding metal from breaking when you heat it up, you need to follow some simple steps. First, heat it to a temperature between 500°C and 600°C. Then, let it cool down slowly afterward. This helps prevent any cracks from forming.\n\nReferences:\n\n- Copper Alloys\n- Brass\n- Ammunition",

          "text": "Gilding metal is an alloy primarily composed of copper and zinc, characterized by a significantly higher copper content compared to zinc. The typical composition ranges from 95% copper and 5% zinc to approximately 87.5% copper and 12.5% zinc, as specified in British Army Dress Regulations.\n\nThis alloy finds application in several areas due to its properties. Gilding metal is commonly used for bullet jackets, driving bands on certain artillery shells, and in the production of enameled badges and jewelry. Additionally, it is extensively utilized in craft metalworking, particularly through hammering techniques. Due to its cost-effectiveness, gilding metal serves as a training material for silversmiths. Notably, during World War II, the United States Mint repurposed gilding metal from melted-down shell casings to produce pennies, replacing the steel cents of 1943. This practice continued until 1946.\n\nIn recent years, gilding metal was employed for the \"bronze\" medals at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nThe alloy can be annealed by heating it to a temperature range of 400°C to 500°C, followed by slow cooling to minimize the risk of cracking.\n\nReferences\n\nCopper Alloys\nBrass\nAmmunition",

      "original_text": "In computer networking and telecommunications, route flapping occurs when a router alternately advertises a destination network via one route then another, or as unavailable and then available again, in quick sequence. \n\nRoute flapping is caused by pathological conditions (hardware errors, software errors, configuration errors, intermittent errors in communications links, unreliable connections, etc.) within the network which cause certain reachability information to be repeatedly advertised and withdrawn. For example, link flap occurs when an interface on a router has a hardware failure that causes the router to announce it alternately as \"up\" and \"down\".\n\nIn networks with link-state routing protocols, route flapping will force frequent recalculation of the topology by all participating routers. In networks with distance-vector routing protocols, route flapping can trigger routing updates with every state change. In both cases, it prevents the network from converging.\n\nRoute flapping can be contained to a smaller area of the network if route aggregation is used. As an aggregate route will not be withdrawn as long as at least one of the aggregated subnets is still valid, a flapping route that is part of an aggregate will not disturb the routers that receive the aggregate.\n\nSee also\n BGP route damping\n Supernet\n\nReferences\n\nFlapping",

It's like a router saying \"I know where this goes\" and then \"Oops, I don't know anymore\" very quickly.\n\nThis can happen because of problems in the network, like broken hardware or mistakes in how the network is set up. For example, if a router's connection to the internet suddenly stops working and then starts working again, it might keep saying \"The internet is here\" and \"The internet is gone.\"\n\nIn some types of networks, like those using link-state routing, every router has to constantly update its map of the network whenever there's a change. This can make the network slow and confused. In other types, like those using distance-vector routing, the routers send updates every time something changes, which can also cause confusion.\n\nTo stop this from happening everywhere, we can use something called route aggregation. This is like grouping several smaller routes into one big route. If only part of the group is working, the big route stays active, and the rest of the network doesn't get confused.\n\nFor more information, see BGP route damping, which is a way to reduce the impact of flapping, and supernetting, which is a technique for grouping smaller routes into larger ones.\n\nReferences:\n\nFlapping",

Imagine you're trying to tell someone how to get to a friend's house, but you keep switching between different directions without a good reason. That's kind of like what happens with route flapping.\n\nThis issue usually happens because something in the network isn't working right. It could be a mistake in how the network is set up, a broken piece of hardware, or a problem with the way data is being sent over the internet. When these things happen, the router starts sending mixed signals about how to reach a particular place, sometimes saying it's reachable and other times saying it's not.\n\nIn networks that use a special kind of routing called \"link-state,\" every router has to constantly figure out the best path based on these mixed signals. This can make the network very unstable. In networks that use \"distance-vector\" routing, the routers send updates every time there's a change, which can also cause problems.\n\nTo limit the impact of route flapping, network administrators can use something called \"route aggregation.\" This means grouping several smaller routes into one bigger route. If only part of the group is still working, the big route won't stop working either. This helps keep the rest of the network running smoothly even if some parts are having trouble.\n\nThere are techniques to reduce the effects of route flapping, such as \"BGP route damping,\" which helps smooth out these changes. Another term related to this is \"supernetting,\" which is a way of grouping multiple IP addresses together to simplify routing.\n\nUnderstanding and managing route flapping is crucial for keeping networks stable and efficient.",

This behavior is typically triggered by various pathological conditions such as hardware failures, software bugs, misconfigurations, or transient issues in communication links.\n\nIn essence, route flapping arises due to inconsistent reachability information being propagated across the network. For instance, link flap refers to the situation where a router's interface experiences repeated transitions between \"up\" and \"down\" states, leading to erratic routing announcements.\n\nIn networks employing link-state routing protocols, such as OSPF, route flapping necessitates frequent recalculations of the network topology by all involved routers. Conversely, in networks using distance-vector routing protocols like RIP, route flapping triggers routing updates with each state change. Both scenarios impede network convergence, potentially causing instability and performance degradation.\n\nTo mitigate the impact of route flapping, route aggregation can be employed. By aggregating multiple subnets into a single aggregate route, the network can continue to function normally even if some of the subnets experience flapping. The aggregate route remains active as long as any of its constituent subnets remain valid, thereby isolating the flapping issue to a localized area of the network.\n\nFor further reading on related topics, see BGP route damping and supernetting.",

          "text": "In ancient Roman mythology, King Numitor, the grandfather of Rome's founders Romulus and Remus, faced a dramatic turn of events. Numitor was supposed to become king after his father, Procas, passed away. However, his brother, Amulius, took over the throne instead. Amulius didn't follow his father’s wishes and removed Numitor from power. To make sure he kept control, Amulius killed Numitor's two sons and didn’t let his sister-in-law, Rhea Silvia, have any children. According to the story, Rhea Silvia was forced to become a Vestal Virgin, which meant she couldn't have kids or she would be punished severely. But somehow, she became pregnant by the god Mars.\n\nDespite this, Romulus and Remus managed to defeat Amulius and restore their grandfather, Numitor, to the throne in 752 BC. This event is a key part of Roman history and forms the basis of many stories and legends.\n\nTo better understand the family connections, you might want to look at a family tree. For more detailed information, you can read about the Aeneid, a famous epic poem, or The Golden Bough, a book that explores myths and rituals.\n\nThis story is also mentioned in Book VI of the Aeneid, an important work of literature that tells the tale of Aeneas, a Trojan hero who becomes a founding figure of Rome.",

          "text": "In Roman mythology, King Numitor, the maternal grandfather of Rome's founders and first king, Romulus and his twin brother Remus, was the son of Procas, a descendant of Aeneas, the legendary Trojan hero. Numitor was succeeded by his brother Amulius upon Procas's death in 794 BCE, despite being designated as the rightful heir. Amulius, disregarding both his father’s wishes and his brother's seniority, deposed Numitor and assumed control of the kingdom. In an attempt to consolidate his power, Amulius ordered the murder of Numitor's sons.\n\nNumitor's daughter, Rhea Silvia, was made a Vestal Virgin by Amulius, a position that required her to remain chaste and childless, punishable by death. However, according to myth, Rhea Silvia was impregnated by the god Mars. The twins, Romulus and Remus, were subsequently raised by a she-wolf and later overthrew Amulius, restoring Numitor to the throne in 752 BCE.\n\n**Family Tree**\n\n**See Also**\n- *Aeneid* by Virgil\n- *The Golden Bough* by Sir James George Frazer\n\n**Notes**\n\n- **Kings of Alba Longa**: Numitor, Amulius, and later Romulus and Remus.\n- **Characters in Book VI of the Aeneid**: Numitor, Amulius, Rhea Silvia, Romulus, and Remus.\n\nThis narrative provides a concise yet detailed account of the mythological lineage and events surrounding the founding of Rome, focusing on the key figures and their roles in the political and familial drama of ancient Italy.",

Before joining Canada in 1873, the island was divided into three areas called counties, which were used to manage local affairs.\n\nIn 1764 and 1765, a British army officer named Captain Samuel Holland drew up detailed maps of the island. He split the land into these three counties, each with a special town called a \"royalty\" or \"shire town.\" This town served as the center for the county. Outside these towns, the land was further divided into smaller areas known as parishes, which were about 20 square miles each. Parishes were then broken down into even smaller units called townships, roughly 4 square miles in size.\n\nToday, these counties don't play a role in how the provincial government runs things. However, they still matter for counting people and gathering information. Statistics Canada, the agency responsible for collecting data in Canada, uses these counties to organize census information.\n\nThis system of dividing the land into counties, parishes, and townships is part of the broader way Canada organizes its regions.

          "text": "\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is a song from a story in a book called *Through the Looking-Glass*. This book was written by Lewis Carroll in 1871. The song is sung by a character named The White Knight.\n\nIn the story, The White Knight explains why the song has different names. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. The song itself is called \"Haddocks' Eyes.\"\n2. But it is also known as \"The Aged Aged Man.\"\n3. The song is also referred to as \"Ways and Means.\"\n4. And it is sometimes called \"A-sitting on a Gate.\"\n\nThese different names show how names can be tricky. They can refer to the actual song, its title, or even the name of the title. This idea is similar to something called the \"use-mention distinction,\" where we talk about the difference between using a word and mentioning a word.\n\nThe song itself is sung to a tune that The White Knight made up. However, Alice recognizes the tune as being similar to a famous poem called \"I give thee all, I can no more.\"\n\nThe song makes fun of another poem called \"Resolution and Independence\" by William Wordsworth, but it doesn’t change the way the poem sounds or its rhythm.\n\nInterestingly, \"Haddocks' Eyes\" was changed over time. In 1856, before Carroll wrote *Through the Looking-Glass*, he published a poem with a similar theme called \"Upon the Lonely Moor.\"\n\nThis song is part of a group of funny and nonsensical poems, often called \"nonsense verse.\" Some other poems like this include those found in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and other books by Lewis Carroll.",

          "text": "In Lewis Carroll's 1871 novel *Through the Looking-Glass*, there's a whimsical song sung by the White Knight, known as \"Haddocks' Eyes.\" This song is a clever way to explore how names work—how they can refer to other names and create layers of meaning.\n\n### Naming the Song\n\nThe White Knight teaches Alice about the confusing names of this song. Here’s what he says:\n\n- The song itself is called \"Haddocks' Eyes.\"\n- But it’s also known as \"The Aged Aged Man.\"\n- The song is referred to as \"Ways and Means.\"\n- And it’s also called \"A-sitting on a Gate.\"\n\nThese different names highlight how names can point to other names, creating a complex web of symbols.\n\n### The Song Itself\n\nThe White Knight sings the song to a tune he claims he made up, but Alice recognizes it as a familiar tune from another poem. By the time Alice hears it, she’s already tired of poetry, showing how repetitive and perhaps tedious the song might be.\n\n### Parody and Inspiration\n\nThe song is a playful take on the plot of \"Resolution and Independence\" by William Wordsworth, but it doesn’t mimic the style or rhythm of the original. Instead, it offers a humorous twist.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nInterestingly, \"Haddocks' Eyes\" seems to have evolved over time. In 1856, Carroll published a similar poem called \"Upon the Lonely Moor,\" which shares many similarities with \"Haddocks' Eyes.\"\n\n### Related Topics\n\nThis poem is part of a broader category of nonsense verse, which includes other works like *Jabberwocky* from the same book. It’s also connected to British poetry from the 1870s, specifically the poems in *Alice's Adventures in Wonderland* and the genre of nonsense poetry.\n\nOverall, \"Haddocks' Eyes\" is a delightful example of how names and references can create intricate layers of meaning, much like a puzzle where each piece fits into another.",

          "text": "\"Haddocks' Eyes\" is a term derived from a song performed by the White Knight in Lewis Carroll's 1871 novel *Through the Looking-Glass*, specifically in Chapter VIII. This term exemplifies the complex nature of naming and symbolization, particularly in the context of self-referential names and multiple layers of symbolization.\n\n### Naming Conventions\n\nThe White Knight elucidates a convoluted nomenclature for the song, which highlights the use-mention distinction—a fundamental concept in logic and philosophy. The song has several names:\n- **Haddocks' Eyes**: The actual title of the song.\n- **The Aged Aged Man**: Another name for the song.\n- **Ways and Means**: Yet another name for the song.\n- **A-sitting on a Gate**: Still another name for the song.\n\nThis intricate naming system underscores the recursive nature of names and their referents, where names can be applied to other names, thereby creating multiple levels of symbolization.\n\n### The Song Itself\n\nThe White Knight performs the song to a tune that he claims to have invented, though Alice recognizes it as a familiar melody, \"I give thee all, I can no more.\" Despite its familiarity, the song is presented in a manner that is likely intended to be nonsensical and whimsical, fitting within the broader context of Carroll's *Through the Looking-Glass*.\n\n### Parodic Elements\n\n\"Haddocks' Eyes\" parodies the plot of \"Resolution and Independence\" by William Wordsworth, but does so without mimicking the original's style or meter. This technique is reminiscent of Carroll's other nonsensical poetry, such as \"Jabberwocky,\" which also underwent revisions over time.\n\n### Historical Context\n\nIn 1856, Carroll published a poem under the title \"Upon the Lonely Moor,\" which shares significant similarities with \"Haddocks' Eyes.\" This suggests that \"Haddocks' Eyes\" may have evolved from earlier versions of the poem, further emphasizing Carroll's creative process and the development of his nonsensical verse.\n\n### Related Works\n\nFor additional context, readers may explore:\n- **Nonsense Verse**: A genre characterized by playful and often nonsensical language.\n- **British Poems**: A broader category encompassing various poetic works from British authors.\n- **1871 Poems**: A collection of poems published in that year.\n- **Alice's Adventures in Wonderland**: The full novel in which \"Haddocks' Eyes",

Many of the first people who came to live there were from Holland, which is why they named it this way.\n\n**Where It Is**\nThe township covers an area of about 3.5 square miles. Most of this is land, with just a tiny bit being water—less than 1%.\n\n**Who Lives There?**\nIn 2000, there were 369 people, 120 families, and 102 households. On average, there were about 10 people per square mile. There were 122 houses, with an average of 3.5 houses per square mile.\n\nMost people there were white, with a few African Americans, people from other races, and a mix of races. About 1% of the population was Hispanic or Latino.\n\n**Families and Households**\nAbout half of the households had kids under 18. Most households were made up of married couples, but some were single people or older adults living alone.\n\nThe average household had about 3 people, and the average family had about 3.4 people.\n\n**Age Groups**\nYounger people made up the largest group, with about one-third under 18. There were also many people in their 20s to 40s, followed by those in their 40s to 64s, and a smaller number of older adults.\n\nFor every 100 women, there were slightly more men—about 105. And for every 100 women over 18, there were even more men—about 114.\n\n**Money Matters**\nThe average household income was around $45,000, and the average family income was a bit higher at about $47,000. Men earned more on average than women. Each person in the township earned about $16,000.\n\nA small percentage of families and people lived below the poverty line, which means they didn't have enough money for basic needs. This was true for about 7% of families and 7% of the overall population, with a slightly higher rate among young people.\n\nThis information gives us a picture of what life was like in Holland Township back",

This means if you have a phone, it can be connected to one or several different places where calls are switched around. Sometimes, all these connections might share the same phone number, making it seem like just one line is handling everything.\n\nIn simpler terms, imagine your phone can talk to different phone companies at the same time, ensuring your calls stay connected even if one company has issues.\n\nIn the military, \"multiple homing\" describes a weapon's ability to target and hit multiple enemies at once. It’s like a missile that can choose and attack several targets without needing to switch its aim.\n\nFor example, a missile can be designed to seek out and destroy multiple enemy vehicles or buildings at the same time, increasing its chances of success in battle.\n\nThis idea is also related to \"homing pigeons,\" which use their sense of direction to return to a specific place, and \"infrared homing,\" where missiles lock onto heat signatures to find their targets.\n\nUnderstanding these concepts helps us see how technology is used in both civilian and military contexts to improve communication and combat effectiveness.",
