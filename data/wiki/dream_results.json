It involves the systematic removal of waste from households, businesses, and public areas, ensuring its transportation for proper recycling and disposal. However, the term \"garbage collection\" can also refer to two distinct processes in the fields of computer science and solid-state drives (SSDs).\n\nIn computer science, garbage collection is a technique used for automatic memory management. This process involves periodically identifying and freeing up memory that is no longer in use by a program, thereby preventing potential memory leaks and improving system performance. Garbage collection is widely used in modern programming languages like Java, C#, and Python, as it simplifies memory management and reduces the risk of memory-related errors.\n\nIn the context of SSDs, garbage collection is a mechanism used to maintain the performance and longevity of flash memory. Flash memory, the underlying technology in SSDs, has a limited number of write cycles before it begins to degrade. Garbage collection in SSDs involves reorganizing data across the drive to balance the wear and tear on individual memory cells, ensuring optimal performance and lifespan.",

He was in charge of installing new pavement in the Forum around the end of the 80 BC. The goddess's job was to protect the new pavement from any fires.\n\nIn the neighborhoods, Stata Mater was very important. People honored her by making dedications at special places called compital shrines in the vici. The leaders of the neighborhood groups, called vicomagistri, often made these dedications. The popularity of Stata Mater shows that fire was a big threat to people in Rome.\n\nStata Mater was sometimes given the title \"Augusta,\" which might be related to the Roman Emperor Augustus. Augustus was a powerful leader who ruled Rome from around 30 BC to the early 14 AD. He reorganized the different regions of Rome in 7 BC, and one of the changes was the creation of neighborhood watches (vigiles) to help control fires.

This cult was believed to be involved in various crimes and political conspiracies during their secret meetings. In response, the Roman Senate issued a decree, known as the Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus, which prohibited the Bacchanalia everywhere in Italy, except in certain special cases that had to be approved by the Senate.\n\n2. Asia Minor: In the region of Asia Minor, a ruler named Eumenes II of Pergamum defeated another ruler named Prusias I of Bithynia.\n\n3. China: The first burial occurred at the famous archaeological site of Mawangdui during the Western Han Dynasty of China.\n\n4. Births: Ptolemy VI Philometor, who would later become the king of Egypt from 180 BC to 145 BC, was born in 186 BC.\n\n5.
