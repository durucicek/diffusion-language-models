For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made manifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding to discretizations of surface integrals. In one dimension, our simulations show that a model with the Wilson derivative and the Stratonovitch prescription for this discretization leads to far better results at finite lattice spacing than other models with Wilson fermions considered in the literature. In particular, we check that fermionic and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward identities are fulfilled to high accuracy. Equally good results for the effective masses can be obtained in a model with the SLAC derivative (even without improvement terms). In two dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that the discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order O(a^2).

The first results are analytical : when no losses are present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold frequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth. Actually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g. the results by Cullen et al..

They often settle into a state that's not quite the same as the one they started with, and this state is called a Quasi Stationary State (QSS).\n\nNow, scientists have been studying a specific type of system called the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, which is like a simplified version of the world around us.

This principle says that the systems will tend towards a state with the highest amount of disorder, or randomness.\n\nWhen scientists looked at how these systems behaved, they found that they could change from one type of QSS to another, depending on the initial conditions. This change happens at a special point called a phase transition, and it can be either first-order (where the change is sudden and dramatic) or second-order (where the change is more gradual).\n\nThe really interesting thing is that these phase transitions can merge at a special point called a tricritical point, where the system is in a state of metastability. This means that it's not quite stable, but it's not quite unstable either - it's stuck in a kind of limbo.\n\nBy studying this behavior, scientists can gain a better understanding of how complex systems behave and how they can change over time.

This force is like a background hum that influences how electrons move and behave.\n\nTo understand how this force affects electrons, scientists use a special equation called the Dirac equation. This equation helps us predict how electrons will behave in different situations, like when they're moving around a nucleus or interacting with other particles.\n\nIn this case, the scientists are looking at how electrons behave in a special kind of electromagnetic field, which is like a combination of electric and magnetic forces. They're using a technique called a \"1/c-series expansion\" to simplify the math and make it easier to understand.\n\nThe results show that this mysterious force, which we'll call \"b0,\" can cause tiny changes in the way electrons behave. These changes can affect the way electrons spin and move, which in turn can affect the way they emit radiation, like light.\n\nIn particular, the scientists found that this force can cause a specific kind of asymmetry in the way light is emitted by a hydrogen atom. This means that the light might not be emitted equally in all directions, but instead might be slightly more intense in one direction than another.\n\nThis effect is known as an \"anapole moment,\" and it's a pretty subtle phenomenon.

This is called a \"superposition\".\n\nTo do this, we use a special device called a beam splitter, which splits the light into two paths. We then use special detectors to monitor the light coming out of each path. Surprisingly, we found that if we detect a certain amount of light coming out of one path, we can be almost certain that the rest of the light will come out of the same path, no matter how many photons we start with.\n\nBut what's even more interesting is that if we detect light coming out of both paths, we can create a special kind of state called a \"Schrödinger cat state\". This is like a superposition of two states, where the light is both in one state and the other state at the same time.\n\nWe've developed a way to make these states orthogonal, or perpendicular, to each other, and then convert them into a special state called a \"N00N state\". This state is important for applications like quantum imaging and metrology, which involve measuring tiny changes in light.\n\nThe best part is that our method is much more efficient than previous proposals, and it scales exponentially better. This means that we can create these special states with many more photons, which could lead to even more powerful applications in the future.",

The basic procedure involves the interaction of number states from a source with a beam splitter, with the output ports monitored by photodetectors. We find that detecting a fixed fraction of the input at one output port is sufficient to direct the remainder to the same port with high probability, regardless of the initial state's magnitude. Conversely, when photons are detected at both ports, Schrödinger cat states are produced. We present a circuit design for orthogonalizing the components of such a state and another for subsequent conversion to a N00N state.

If this map covers the original landscape away from the rough patches, then it must be \"birational\", which means that it can be transformed into the original landscape by a simple stretchy transformation.\n\nIn summary, our counting argument and surgery theory show that if a local diffeomorphism is a d-sheeted cover away from a rough patch, then it's either a simple stretchy sheet or a highly distorted sheet.

This theory says that the universe is made up of four dimensions: three for space and one for time. It's a bit like a big fabric that's curved and warped by the presence of massive objects like planets and stars.\n\nNow, when we try to understand the behavior of these tiny strings, we need to use a different set of rules, called quantum mechanics. This is like a different language that helps us describe how these strings vibrate and interact with each other.\n\nOne way to think about it is to imagine a big library with an infinite number of books. Each book represents a possible configuration of the universe, and the pages of the book represent the different ways that the strings can vibrate. The entropy of a configuration is like the number of pages that are filled with information. The more pages that are filled, the more complex and disordered the configuration is.\n\nIn this scenario, the most likely configurations are the ones with the fewest pages filled, or the lowest entropy. This means that the universe tends to settle into a state of minimal disorder, which is kind of like the most organized and efficient way to arrange the books on the shelves.\n\nNow, when we look at the universe on a large scale, we can use a different set of rules to describe how it behaves. This is called classical geometry, and it's like a simplified version of the rules that govern the behavior of the strings. The entropy-weighted sum that we mentioned earlier reduces to something called the Feynman path integral, which is a way of calculating the probability of different outcomes.\n\nThis scenario is really powerful because it allows us to make predictions about the behavior of particles and forces in the universe. We can use it to calculate things like the masses of particles, the strength of forces, and even the age of the universe.

This technique, called gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15% (plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior. Gyro ages are then calculated for each of the active main sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators where other ages are not available. These are shown to be mostly younger than 1Gyr, with a median age of 365Myr. The sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars assembled by Pizzolato and collaborators is then assessed, and shown to have gyro ages ranging from under 100Myr to several Gyr, and a median age of 1.2Gyr.

We initially establish the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying characteristic of rotational observations of cluster and field stars that enables the technique, and extend it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars.

The field is produced by a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are investigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced magnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid sodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the time-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell, but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic flow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is controlled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the observed velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in the linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared with the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model provides very good predictions.

This means that the map preserves the angles between lines and planes in the surface. We also show that if a group of transformations acts on the surface in a special way, the map will preserve this action.\n\nUsing this map, we can find the shape of the surface in the higher-dimensional space. We also find some conditions that guarantee that the map is a rotation hypersurface, which is a special kind of surface that can be obtained by rotating a lower-dimensional surface around a line.\n\nFinally, we show that compact Euclidean rotation hypersurfaces have a special structure called a warped product structure. This means that the surface can be built by gluing together smaller pieces in a specific way.\n\nIn summary, we've found a way to map curved surfaces onto flat spaces without distorting their shape, and we've characterized the properties of these surfaces in terms of their underlying structure.",

SQUID is a way to measure the strength of a magnetic field, while PNR is a technique that helps us understand the structure of the layers.\n\nThe team measured the magnetic properties of the layers at very low temperatures (just 10 Kelvin, which is -263°C) and in strong magnetic fields (up to 70,000 times stronger than the Earth's magnetic field). They also studied how the magnetic properties changed as the temperature increased.\n\nFor the U/Fe and U/Co layers, they found that the magnetic field didn't penetrate very far into the layers, which suggests that the interfaces between the layers were \"mixed\" or \"interdiffused\". This means that the atoms from the different layers had blended together, creating a kind of \"magnetic dead zone\".\n\nIn contrast, the U/Gd layers showed a much weaker magnetic response, with a magnetic moment that was significantly reduced compared to the bulk metal. This could be due to the way the Gd layers grew, forming \"columns\" that pinned the magnetic moments in place.\n\nThe researchers also found that the magnetic properties of the U/Gd layers changed as the thickness of the Gd layers increased. They observed a reduction in the Curie temperature, which is the temperature at which a material loses its magnetic properties.

To study this question, researchers have used computer simulations that mimic the behavior of thousands or even millions of particles. However, some experts have raised concerns that these simulations might not be reliable.\n\nA recent study by Weinberg and Katz suggested that these simulations might not accurately capture the effects of dark matter if they don't use an extremely large number of particles. But is this really the case? To find out, I conducted my own research to test their claim. My results show that the number of particles used in the simulation doesn't affect the outcome, as long as it's within a certain range. I also found that different methods of simulating the behavior of the particles (grid methods versus field methods) produce the same results.\n\nSo, why did Weinberg and Katz think that a huge number of particles was needed? I identified the reasons behind their suggestion and found that it's actually unnecessary. My study provides a more accurate understanding of how to simulate the interactions between dark matter and the spinning arms of galaxies, and it shows that we don't need to use an excessive number of particles to get reliable results.",

      "original_text": "Context. One of the typical features shown by observations of solar prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions. Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those observed.",

The time it takes for the movements to slow down is usually between one and three times the time it takes for the movement to complete one cycle. But scientists still don't fully understand why this happens.\n\nThe goal of this study is to figure out how heat, light, and other forms of energy affect the slowing down of these movements. To do this, we'll look at how energy moves through a special kind of gas called plasma, which is found in the sun's atmosphere.\n\nWe'll use a special equation to understand how energy moves through this plasma. This equation takes into account the strength of the magnetic field, which is like a kind of invisible force that affects the movement of the plasma. We'll solve this equation to see how the energy moves and how it affects the slowing down of the movements.\n\nOur results show that the way energy moves affects the slowing down of the movements differently depending on the type of movement and the distance from the sun. In some cases, the energy from the plasma itself slows down the movement, while in other cases, energy from the surrounding corona (the outer atmosphere of the sun) plays a bigger role.\n\nThe most important thing we found is that the energy from the corona has a big impact on the slowing down of some movements, but not others. This means that scientists need to consider the corona when studying these movements.\n\nOverall, our study shows that the way energy moves through the plasma is an important factor in slowing down the movements of solar prominences, and our results match what scientists have observed.",

The rate at which they die down, or \"dampen,\" is usually between one and three times the time it takes for the oscillation to complete one cycle. But the reason behind this damping is still a mystery.\n\nThe goal of this study is to understand how different factors, such as heat transfer, radiation, and heating, contribute to the damping of these oscillations.\n\nTo do this, the researchers used a mathematical model to simulate the behavior of a prominence, which is a cloud of hot, ionized gas in the sun's atmosphere. They assumed that the magnetic field in the prominence is aligned with the direction of the prominence itself, and that the strength of the magnetic field is the same throughout.\n\nBy solving the equations of this model, the researchers found that the way in which the oscillations are damped depends on the type of oscillation and the wavelength of the wave. They discovered that the slowest type of oscillation, which is internal to the prominence, is damped by radiation from the prominence itself. The fastest type of oscillation, which is a combination of the prominence and the surrounding corona, is damped by a combination of radiation from the prominence and heat transfer from the corona. The slowest type of oscillation that occurs outside the prominence is damped by heat transfer from the corona.\n\nThe researchers found that the surrounding corona plays a crucial role in the damping of the fastest and slowest types of oscillations, but has no effect on the internal slow oscillations.\n\nOverall, this study shows that non-adiabatic effects, or changes in the energy of the oscillations, are important mechanisms for damping magnetoacoustic waves, and the results are consistent with what has been observed in the past.",

At higher altitudes, the temperature pattern follows the pattern of the sun's illumination, but at lower pressures, the jet stream takes over and dominates the temperature pattern.\n\nOur simulations also suggest that the amount of heat emitted by the planet into space can vary significantly throughout its orbit around the star. If the layer of the atmosphere where the sun's light is absorbed is deep enough, the peak amount of heat emitted by the planet should occur before the secondary eclipse, which is when the planet passes behind the star. This delay could be as long as 10 hours or more.\n\nThe movement of the atmosphere on this planet plays a crucial role in shaping the planet's climate, the formation of clouds, and the chemical composition of the atmosphere.

This hypothesis is tested in the present paper on a two-dimensional Coulomb gas of pointlike $+/-$ unit charges interacting via a logarithmic potential which is equivalent to an integrable sine-Gordon field model. In particular, we apply a form factor method to obtain the exact asymptotic large-distance behavior of particle correlation functions, considered in the charge and number density combinations. We first determine the general forms of the leading and subleading asymptotic terms at strictly positive $\\beta>0$ and then evaluate their high-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ forms. In the case of the {\\em charge} correlation function, the leading asymptotic term at a strictly positive $\\beta>0$ is also the leading one in the high-temperature $\\beta\\to 0$ regime.

To find these companions, we used special cameras that capture light in different parts of the spectrum, including visible light, near-infrared light, and a special type of infrared light that's invisible to the human eye.\n\nOur search led us to discover a very unusual binary system, which we've named LOri167. It's made up of two objects: a brown dwarf, which is a type of small, cool star, and a planetary-mass object, which is much smaller and cooler. These two objects are about 5 arcseconds apart, which is a relatively large distance in astronomical terms.\n\nBy studying the temperature of these objects, we found that the brown dwarf has a surface temperature of about 2,125 Kelvin (or -250°C), while the planetary-mass object has a surface temperature of about 1,750 Kelvin (or -500°C). If these objects are indeed part of the Lambda Orionis cluster, our calculations suggest that the brown dwarf has a mass of about 17 times that of Jupiter, while the planetary-mass object has a mass of about 8 times that of Jupiter.\n\nWhat's remarkable about this binary system is that it's difficult to explain using current theories about how stars and planets form. Typically, smaller objects like brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects form in the disks surrounding larger stars, but this system doesn't fit that pattern.",
