For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made manifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding to discretizations of surface integrals. In one dimension, our simulations show that a model with the Wilson derivative and the Stratonovitch prescription for this discretization leads to far better results at finite lattice spacing than other models with Wilson fermions considered in the literature. In particular, we check that fermionic and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward identities are fulfilled to high accuracy. Equally good results for the effective masses can be obtained in a model with the SLAC derivative (even without improvement terms). In two dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that the discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order O(a^2). Masses extracted from the corresponding manifestly supersymmetric model prove to approach their continuum values much quicker than those from a model containing the standard Wilson term.

This model represents the most common representation of a lip-type valve, where the valve is assumed to be a single degree of freedom oscillator. The presented research builds upon the work of Wilson and Beavers (1974) and Tarnopolsky (2000).\n\nThe investigation focuses on the range of playable frequencies. The initial analytical findings demonstrate that, in the absence of losses in the resonator, the ratio between the threshold frequency and the reed's resonance frequency necessarily falls within the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This interval corresponds to a musical sixth. However, the actual interval is significantly smaller, consistent with the results of Cullen et al.\n\nThe smallest blowing pressure is found to be directly proportional to the quality factor of the reed. Numerical results validate these findings and are discussed in relation to previous studies by Cullen et al. (2000).\n\nClarifications:\n- \"Striking outwards\" refers to the configuration of the reed where the mouthpiece strikes the reed from outside.\n- \"Single degree of freedom oscillator\" implies that the valve has only one degree of freedom in its oscillation.\n- \"Threshold frequency\" is the frequency at which the reed begins to vibrate.\n- \"Resonance frequency\" is the frequency at which the reed vibrates most strongly.\n- \"Quality factor\" is a measure of the sharpness of the reed's resonance.\n- \"Musical sixth\" is a musical interval corresponding to a ratio of 2:1.",

Along this class of vacua a four-dimensional space-time is automatically selected; when, at large volume, a description of space-time in terms of classical geometry can be recovered, the entropy-weighted sum reduces to the ordinary Feynman's path integral.

This functional weighs all the possible ways the strings can vibrate based on their \"entropy.\" Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness, so the most likely ways the strings will vibrate are the ones with the least disorder.\n\nThis leads to a highly predictive model of the universe, where everything is determined by the fundamental constants and the age of the universe. There are no free parameters that can be adjusted.\n\nThis model has been tested against experimental observations and measurements, and it holds up well. It also explains the known spectrum of particles and interactions, as well as the behavior of the universe itself.",

This framework underscores the quantum nature of physical phenomena and directly leads to a string theory scenario. The dynamics of this scenario are governed by a functional that weights all configurations according to their entropy. The most favored configurations are those with minimal entropy, which automatically select a four-dimensional space-time. At large volumes, a classical description of space-time can be recovered, and the entropy-weighted sum reduces to the ordinary Feynman's path integral. This results in a highly predictive scenario that is phenomenologically consistent with experimental observations and measurements. Everything in this scenario is determined by fundamental constants and the age of the universe, leaving no room for freely adjustable parameters. We discuss how this framework leads to the known spectrum of particles and interactions. Additionally, we examine the computation of masses and couplings, CKM matrix elements, cosmological constant, and expansion parameters of the universe, all of which, within the degree of approximation used, align with experimental observations. Finally, we discuss how this scenario meets the tests imposed by cosmology and the constraints imposed by the physics of the primordial universe.",

To this end, the SLIV which evolves in a general Yang-Mills type theory with the nonlinear vector field constraint $Tr(% \\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu }\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu})=\\pm M^{2}$ ($M$ is a proposed SLIV scale) imposed is considered in detail. With an internal symmetry group $G$ having $D$ generators not only the pure Lorentz symmetry SO(1,3), but the larger accidental symmetry $SO(D,3D)$ of the SLIV constraint in itself appears to be spontaneously broken as well. As a result, while the pure Lorentz violation still generates only one genuine Goldstone vector boson, the accompanying pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons related to the $SO(D,3D)$ breaking also come into play in the final arrangement of the entire Goldstone vector field multiplet. Remarkably, they remain strictly massless, being protected by gauge invariance of the Yang-Mills theory involved. We show that, although this theory contains a plethora of Lorentz and $CPT$ violating couplings, they do not lead to physical SLIV effects which turn out to be strictly cancelled in all the lowest order processes considered. However, the physical Lorentz violation could appear if the internal gauge invariance were slightly broken at very small distances influenced by gravity.

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions.

While a small number of altruists may improve social welfare, too many can also cause the system to experience a monetary crash, which may be bad for social welfare.

For instance, the frequencies of normal mode oscillations can be used to determine the elusive angular momentum parameter of the black hole. The general formalism developed by diskoseismologists for relativistic systems can be readily applied to the Newtonian case of cataclysmic variables (CVs). Some of these systems, such as the dwarf nova SS Cygni, exhibit rapid oscillations in the UV with periods of tens of seconds and high coherence. In this paper, we investigate the possibility that these dwarf nova oscillations (DNOs) could be diskoseismic modes. In addition to its significance in understanding the physical origin of DNOs, this study aims to address the following question: to what extent do the similarities in the oscillation phenomenology of CVs and X-ray binaries (XRBs) suggest a common physical mechanism?",

Finally, the experiments showed that temperature can be defined and measured in a way that doesn't depend on the observer's point of view.",

Among the various proposed distributions, the Juettner function and its modifications have garnered significant attention. Here, we present the outcomes of fully relativistic one-dimensional (1D) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations that unequivocally resolve this ambiguity. The numerical data unequivocally supports the Juettner distribution. Furthermore, our simulations demonstrate that the concept of thermal equilibrium can be naturally extended to special relativity, provided that the many-particle system is spatially confined. Additionally, the simulations reveal that temperature can be statistically defined and measured in a manner that is independent of the observer's frame of reference.",
