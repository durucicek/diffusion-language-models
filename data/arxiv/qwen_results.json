For any choice of the lattice derivative, the theories can be made manifestly supersymmetric by adding appropriate improvement terms corresponding to discretizations of surface integrals. In one dimension, our simulations show that a model with the Wilson derivative and the Stratonovitch prescription for this discretization leads to far better results at finite lattice spacing than other models with Wilson fermions considered in the literature. In particular, we check that fermionic and bosonic masses coincide and the unbroken Ward identities are fulfilled to high accuracy. Equally good results for the effective masses can be obtained in a model with the SLAC derivative (even without improvement terms). In two dimensions we introduce a non-standard Wilson term in such a way that the discretization errors of the kinetic terms are only of order O(a^2). Masses extracted from the corresponding manifestly supersymmetric model prove to approach their continuum values much quicker than those from a model containing the standard Wilson term. Again, a comparable enhancement can be achieved in a theory using the SLAC derivative.",

We'll call this changing surface $\\Sigma$, and we'll measure its growth using a variable $r$, similar to how time passes.\n\nNow, let's say you want to make sure that this surface has a specific shape at every moment. To do this, you need to solve a complex equation called the \"parabolic scalar curvature equation.\" This equation helps you figure out how to adjust the metric (or distance measurements) on the surface so that it matches the desired shape, which we'll call $R$.\n\nThe equation looks complicated, but think of it as a recipe for adjusting the surface's shape based on two ingredients: the current shape of the surface ($\\gamma$) and the desired shape ($R$). When you follow this recipe correctly, you can create a new metric $g$ that gives the surface the exact shape you want.\n\nIn our scenario, the surface is expanding as $r$ increases, much like a balloon getting bigger. When the surface expands, the equation becomes what we call \"parabolic,\" which means it behaves in a predictable way as it grows.\n\nTo solve this equation, you start with a known shape at a certain point in time ($r = r_0$), and then you try to find out how the surface should look at all future times. The goal is to find a solution that works for as long as possible, ideally forever ($r_1 = \\infty$). However, sometimes the surface can become too curved or stretched out in a finite amount of time, leading to what we call \"blow-up\" — the surface becomes too distorted to continue smoothly.\n\nThe interesting part of this study is when the surface does blow up, but in a controlled way. Even though the surface gets too curved at a specific time ($r_1$), it can still be extended smoothly to include that moment, creating a complete picture of the surface's evolution from the start to the end. This is done by adding a boundary at the point where the surface blows up, ensuring that the entire structure remains a valid, continuous surface.",

The presented work is an extension of the works done by Wilson and Beavers (1974), Tarnopolsky (2000). The range of the playing frequencies is investigated. The first results are analytical : when no losses are present in the resonator, it is proven that the ratio between the threshold frequency and the reed resonance frequency is found to be necessarily within the interval between unity and the square root of 3. This is a musical sixth. Actually the interval is largely smaller, and this is in accordance with e.g. the results by Cullen et al.. The smallest blowing pressure is found to be directly related to the quality factor of the reed.

While the exact term \"striking outwards\" isn't explained here, it refers to a common way that wind instruments like clarinets or saxophones produce sound. When you blow into these instruments, the reed vibrates, creating sound waves inside the instrument.\n\nThis research builds on earlier work by scientists Wilson and Beavers from 1974 and Tarnopolsky from 2000. They were interested in how different frequencies of sound can be produced by changing the way you blow into the instrument.\n\nThe study explores the range of sounds that can be made. When there's no energy loss in the instrument (meaning all the sound stays inside), they found that the frequency at which the reed starts to vibrate (the threshold frequency) is always between one and the square root of three times the natural frequency of the reed itself. This difference in frequencies is known as a musical sixth, which is a specific interval in music theory.\n\nIn simpler terms, the smallest amount of air pressure needed to make the reed vibrate is closely linked to how well the reed can maintain its vibration without losing energy. The numerical results from this study match up well with earlier findings by Cullen and colleagues, confirming the accuracy of their conclusions.\n\nOverall, this research helps us better understand how wind instruments produce different notes and how small changes in the instrument or the player's technique can affect the sound.",

The linear problem has been solved for a wide range of jet models well inside the ultrarelativistic domain (flow Lorentz factors up to 20; specific internal energies $\\approx 60c^2$). As a distinct feature of our work, we have combined the analytical linear approach with high-resolution relativistic hydrodynamical simulations, which has allowed us i) to identify, in the linear regime, resonant modes specific to the relativistic shear layer ii) to confirm the result of the linear analysis with numerical simulations and, iii) more interestingly, to follow the instability development through the non-linear regime. We find that very high-order reflection modes with dominant growth rates can modify the global, long-term stability of the relativistic flow. We discuss the dependence of these resonant modes on the jet flow Lorentz factor and specific internal energy, and on the shear layer thickness.

What arises is a highly predictive scenario, phenomenologically compatible with the experimental observations and measurements, in which everything is determined in terms of the fundamental constants and the age of the Universe, with no room for freely-adjustable parameters. We discuss how this leads to the known spectrum of particles and interactions. Besides the computation of masses and couplings, CKM matrix elements, cosmological constant, expansion parameters of the Universe etc..., all resulting, within the degree of the approximation we used, in agreement with the experimental observations, we also discuss how this scenario passes the tests provided by cosmology and the constraints imposed by the physics of the primordial Universe.",

These rules usually stay the same no matter how you look at them. But in our case, these rules can change, leading to SLIV.\n\nIn a specific kind of theory called Yang-Mills, we add a rule that makes sure a certain vector field behaves in a particular way. This rule is written as \\( \\text{Tr}(\\boldsymbol{A}_{\\mu}\\boldsymbol{A}^{\\mu}) = \\pm M^2 \\), where \\( M \\) is a number that tells us how much the rules can change.\n\nWhen we apply this rule, it breaks some symmetries.

But now, another symmetry called \\( SO(D,3D) \\) is also broken. This means that the new rules affect more than just the usual ways things move.\n\nBecause of this, instead of just one particle being affected, multiple particles come into play. These particles are called pseudo-Goldstone vector bosons.

We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15% (plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior.

      "original_text": "In order to explore the magnetostrophic regime expected for planetary cores, experiments have been conducted in a rotating sphere filled with liquid sodium, with an imposed dipolar magnetic field (the DTS setup). The field is produced by a permanent magnet enclosed in an inner sphere, which can rotate at a separate rate, producing a spherical Couette flow. The flow properties are investigated by measuring electric potentials on the outer sphere, the induced magnetic field in the laboratory frame, and velocity profiles inside the liquid sodium using ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry. The present article focuses on the time-averaged axisymmetric part of the flow. The Doppler profiles show that the angular velocity of the fluid is relatively uniform in most of the fluid shell, but rises near the inner sphere, revealing the presence of a magnetic wind, and gently drops towards the outer sphere. The transition from a magnetostrophic flow near the inner sphere to a geostrophic flow near the outer sphere is controlled by the local Elsasser number. For Rossby numbers up to order 1, the observed velocity profiles all show a similar shape. Numerical simulations in the linear regime are computed, and synthetic velocity profiles are compared with the measured ones. In the geostrophic region, a torque-balance model provides very good predictions. We find that the induced magnetic field varies in a consistent fashion, and displays a peculiar peak in the counter-rotating regime. This happens when the fluid rotation rate is almost equal and opposite to the outer sphere rotation rate. The fluid is then almost at rest in the laboratory frame, and the Proudman-Taylor constraint vanishes, enabling a strong meridional flow. We suggest that dynamo action might be favored in such a situation.",

This machine could spin at different speeds than the big ball.

They used a big ball filled with a metal called sodium, which can move around. Inside this ball, they placed a powerful magnet that could spin separately, creating a swirling motion of the sodium called a \"Couette flow.\" \n\nTo understand what was happening inside, they measured several things:\n- Electric potentials on the outside of the ball to see how the sodium was moving.\n- Magnetic fields to track how the magnetic force was changing.\n- Velocities of the sodium using sound waves to measure its speed.\n\nThe main focus of their study was the steady, symmetrical part of the flow. What they found was that the sodium moved at a fairly constant speed throughout most of the ball, but sped up near the center where the magnet was. This faster movement near the center is like a \"magnetic wind.\" As you move outward, the speed gradually decreases.\n\nThe change from a \"magnetostrophic\" flow (where the magnetic field controls the motion) to a \"geostrophic\" flow (where gravity controls the motion) depends on something called the \"Elsasser number,\" which is a way to compare the strength of the magnetic field to the fluid's motion.\n\nWhen the sodium's spinning speed was close to, but opposite, the ball’s outer spinning speed, the sodium almost stopped moving relative to the lab. This made a special kind of flow possible, called a \"meridional flow,\" which moves up and down through the ball.\n\nThey also did computer simulations to predict what should happen and compared these predictions with their actual measurements. In the area where gravity mainly controls the flow, their predictions were very accurate.\n\nInterestingly, when the sodium's spinning speed matched the ball’s outer spinning speed in the opposite direction, the magnetic field showed a unique pattern, with a noticeable peak. This happens because the Proudman-Taylor constraint, which usually keeps the fluid moving, disappears, allowing for strong vertical currents.\n\nThese findings suggest that conditions like these might help generate magnetic fields in planets, a process known as \"dynamo action.\"",

Concurrent measurements of CR proton and helium spectra by the Payload for Antimatter-Matter Exploration and Light-Nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA), alongside observations of the albedo gamma rays by the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT), will facilitate validation of model predictions and enable the GLAST LAT to monitor the CR spectrum near Earth beyond the operational lifespan of PAMELA.",

One of the typical features shown by observations of solar prominence oscillations is that they are damped in time and that the values of the damping times are usually between one and three times the corresponding oscillatory period. However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction. The consideration of the external corona is of paramount importance in the case of the fast and external slow modes, whereas it does not affect the internal slow modes at all. Conclusions. Non-adiabatic effects are efficient damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic modes, and the values of the obtained damping times are compatible with those observed.",

Scientists have noticed that this slowing down happens within about 1 to 3 times the time it takes for the prominences to complete one full up-and-down movement.\n\n**Aims:**\nScientists want to understand what causes this slowing down. They consider three main factors: heat moving through the gas (thermal conduction), light escaping into space (radiation), and extra heating (heating).\n\n**Methods:**\nTo study this, scientists use a mathematical tool called a \"dispersion relation.\" This helps them understand how different types of waves behave in the Sun's atmosphere. They imagine a slice of the prominence (a layer of hot gas) sitting inside a larger area of the Sun's outer atmosphere (the corona). They assume the magnetic field runs parallel to the slice and is equally strong everywhere.\n\nBy solving the dispersion relation for a specific type of wave, they find out how the wave behaves over time. They calculate two things: the time it takes for the wave to complete one cycle (the period) and how quickly the wave slows down (the damping time).\n\n**Results:**\nThe results show that different types of waves are affected differently by heat and light:\n\n- For the \"internal slow mode,\" which is a type of wave, light from the prominence itself causes it to slow down.\n- For the \"fast mode,\" both light from the prominence and heat from the outer atmosphere cause it to slow down.\n- For the \"external slow mode,\" only the heat from the outer atmosphere affects it.\n\nIt's especially important to consider the outer atmosphere when studying the fast and external slow modes, but it doesn't change the behavior of the internal slow modes.\n\n**Conclusions:**\nThese findings suggest that non-adiabatic effects (changes that happen due to heat and light) can effectively slow down the waves in the Sun's atmosphere.

Scientists have found that this slowing down happens within about one to three times the period of the oscillation. However, the exact reason behind this behavior remains a mystery.\n\n### Goals of the Study\n\nTo better understand what causes this slowing down, scientists considered several factors in their study. These included how heat moves through the prominence (thermal conduction), how light travels through it (radiation), and how the prominence is heated up.\n\n### How the Study Was Conducted\n\nThe researchers looked at how sound-like waves (magnetoacoustic waves) behave in a specific setup. They imagined a slice of prominence plasma (the hot, ionized gas) sitting inside a larger area called the corona, which surrounds the Sun. The magnetic field was aligned parallel to the slice and had the same strength everywhere.\n\nBy analyzing these waves, the scientists could calculate the frequency of the oscillations and how quickly they dampen. This was done for different types of waves and at various wavelengths.\n\n### Key Findings\n\n1. **Different Effects for Different Waves**: The way heat and light affect the waves depends on the type of wave and its wavelength.\n2. **Radiation and Conduction**: \n   - For the \"internal slow mode,\" radiation from the prominence itself causes the wave to dampen.\n   - For the \"fast mode,\" both the radiation from the prominence and the heat loss from the surrounding corona contribute to dampening.\n   - For the \"external slow mode,\" it’s mainly the heat loss from the corona that causes the wave to dampen.\n3. **Importance of the External Corona**: For the fast and external slow modes, considering the external corona is crucial. However, for the internal slow modes, the external corona doesn’t play a significant role.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe study shows that non-adiabatic effects (changes in temperature and pressure that aren't immediately balanced) can effectively dampen these waves. The calculated dampening times match what is observed in real solar prominences. This means we're getting closer to understanding why these oscillations slow down over time.",

Despite this observation, the underlying physical mechanism responsible for this damping remains elusive. This study aims to evaluate the roles of thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation, and heating within the context of the energy equation to elucidate the damping process.\n\nTo achieve this, we derive the dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves in a model where a prominence plasma slab is embedded within an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is assumed to be aligned parallel to the slab's axis and uniform across the regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, we obtain a complex oscillatory frequency, from which we can compute both the oscillation period and the damping time.\n\nOur results indicate that the influence of conduction and radiation losses varies among different magnetoacoustic modes and is dependent on the wavenumber. Specifically, within the observed wavelength range, the internal slow mode is primarily damped by radiation from the prominence plasma, while the fast mode is damped by the combined effects of prominence radiation and coronal conduction. The external slow mode, on the other hand, is predominantly damped by coronal conduction. Notably, the inclusion of the external corona is crucial for understanding the damping of the fast and external slow modes but has no significant impact on the internal slow modes.\n\nThese findings suggest that non-adiabatic effects are effective damping mechanisms for magnetoacoustic modes, and the calculated damping times align well with observational data.",

On one side of the box, there's a special wall that heats up and pushes the balls around.

This technique helps us see how the metals are arranged magnetically.\n\nThe difference in how the domains appeared was because of something called \"magneto-crystalline anisotropy.\" This is a fancy term that means the way the atoms in the cobalt layer are aligned makes them more or less sensitive to magnetic fields. In our case, this alignment helped us clearly see the differences between the two types of domains.\n\nWhat's really interesting is that even though there aren't many of these tiny magnetic points in the iron-manganese layer, they're still strong enough to make a difference when we look at the cobalt layer. This shows how sensitive our method is, allowing us to detect very small magnetic effects in materials.",

To test this idea, researchers looked at a special kind of fluid made up of tiny particles with either positive or negative charges. These particles interact with each other in a way that's similar to how particles in a sine-Gordon model behave.\n\nTo study these interactions, the scientists used a method called \"form factors\" to figure out how the particles' behavior changes over long distances. They found that when the temperature is still quite high, the main pattern of how the particles interact doesn't change much.

Specifically, there's a noticeable difference in how the particles spread out when you go from slightly warm temperatures to the very high-temperature limit described by the Debye-Hückel theory.\n\nThis finding is important because it shows that the way particles interact at long distances and the high-temperature limit don't always match up perfectly, especially when looking at how closely packed the particles are.

      "original_text": "The structure of three laminar premixed rich flames has been investigated: a pure methane flame and two methane flames doped by allene and propyne, respectively. The gases of the three flames contain 20.9% (molar) of methane and 33.4% of oxygen, corresponding to an equivalence ratio of 1.25 for the pure methane flame. In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K. The concentration profiles of stable species were measured by gas chromatography after sampling with a quartz microprobe. Quantified species included carbon monoxide and dioxide, methane, oxygen, hydrogen, ethane, ethylene, acetylene, propyne, allene, propene, propane, 1,2-butadiene, 1,3-butadiene, 1-butene, isobutene, 1-butyne, vinylacetylene, and benzene. The temperature was measured using a PtRh (6%)-PtRh (30%) thermocouple settled inside the enclosure and ranged from 700 K close to the burner up to 1850 K. In order to model these new results, some improvements have been made to a mechanism previously developed in our laboratory for the reactions of C3-C4 unsaturated hydrocarbons. The main reaction pathways of consumption of allene and propyne and of formation of C6 aromatic species have been derived from flow rate analyses.",

For the pure methane flame, this mix was just right to make the flame burn well.

They also made sure the gas moved through the burner at a steady speed of about 36 centimeters per second at a temperature of 333 Kelvin.\n\nUsing a tiny glass probe, they collected samples of the gases in the flames and then analyzed them with a machine called a gas chromatograph.

At the order $\\cal{O}(\\alpha_s^2)$, twist-four contributions from quark-quark (antiquark) rescattering also exhibit the Landau-Pomeranchuck-Midgal (LPM) interference feature similar to gluon bremsstrahlung induced by multiple parton scattering. Compared to quark-gluon scattering, the modification, which is dominated by $t$-channel quark-quark (antiquark) scattering, is only smaller by a factor of $C_F/C_A=4/9$ times the ratio of quark and gluon distributions in the medium. Such a modification is not negligible for realistic kinematics and finite medium size. The modifications to quark (antiquark) fragmentation functions from quark-antiquark annihilation processes are shown to be determined by the antiquark (quark) distribution density in the medium. The asymmetry in quark and antiquark distributions in nuclei will lead to different modifications of quark and antiquark fragmentation functions inside a nucleus, which qualitatively explains the experimentally observed flavor dependence of the leading hadron suppression in semi-inclusive DIS off nuclear targets. The quark-antiquark annihilation processes also mix quark and gluon fragmentation functions in the large fractional momentum region, leading to a flavor dependence of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.",
