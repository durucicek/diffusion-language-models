By using a special model, called the Hamiltonian Mean Field (HMF) model, we can understand how these systems behave.

This principle helps us predict how the system will change between different states, called out-of-equilibrium phase transitions.\n\nWhen we look at a group of similar systems, called \"water-bags,\" we can see how they behave under different starting conditions. We find that there are two types of phase transitions: first-order and second-order. These transitions happen when the system changes from one state to another, and we can see them on a graph.

This technique, called gyrochronology, permits the derivation of ages for solar- and late-type main sequence stars using only their rotation periods and colors. The technique is clarified and developed here, and used to derive ages for illustrative groups of nearby, late-type field stars with measured rotation periods. We first demonstrate the reality of the interface sequence, the unifying feature of the rotational observations of cluster and field stars that makes the technique possible, and extends it beyond the proposal of Skumanich by specifying the mass dependence of rotation for these stars. We delineate which stars it cannot currently be used on. We then calibrate the age dependence using the Sun. The errors are propagated to understand their dependence on color and period. Representative age errors associated with the technique are estimated at ~15% (plus possible systematic errors) for late-F, G, K, & early-M stars. Ages derived via gyrochronology for the Mt. Wilson stars are shown to be in good agreement with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and probably superior.

Wilson stars are found to agree well with chromospheric ages for all but the bluest stars, and are likely superior. We then calculate gyro ages for the active main sequence field stars studied by Strassmeier and collaborators, where other ages are not available. These stars are shown to be mostly younger than 1 billion years, with a median age of 365 million years.\n\nFurthermore, we assess the sample of single, late-type main sequence field stars compiled by Pizzolato and collaborators, and find that their gyro ages range from under 100 million years to several billion years, with a median age of 1.2 billion years.\n\nFinally, we demonstrate that the individual components of the three wide binaries XiBooAB, 61CygAB, and AlphaCenAB have substantially the same gyro ages.",

In 1987, a supernova occurred in a nearby galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud, which is a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. This supernova, called Supernova 1987A, gave scientists a unique opportunity to study what happens after a star explodes.\n\nWhen a supernova happens, the star's core collapses inward, causing a massive explosion. This explosion expels huge amounts of material into space, and as this material moves outward, it interacts with the material that surrounds the star. After the explosion, the ejecta, or the material that was expelled, initially moved outward at more than 10% of the speed of light. However, as they began to encounter the dense material around the star, they quickly slowed down.\n\nThe material from the supernova created a shockwave, which is a wave of energy that travels through the material. This shockwave produced a type of light called radio synchrotron emission, which is a type of radio wave that can be detected by instruments like the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The ATCA has been taking images of the supernova for 15 years, and these images show that the material from the supernova has been expanding faster and faster over time.\n\nIn 1992, the material was moving at about 3600 kilometers per second, but by 2006, it was moving at about 5200 kilometers per second. This means that the material from the supernova has accelerated in its expansion.\n\nScientists also found that the size of the X-ray shell, which is another type of light produced by the supernova, was about 15% smaller than the radio shell. However, when they analyzed both the radio and X-ray data together, they found that the size of the shell in both types of light was about the same, around 1.7 arcseconds.\n\nThe radio images also showed that the material from the supernova was not evenly distributed. The eastern and western parts of the material were brighter than the northern and southern parts. This suggests that most of the radio emission comes from the equatorial plane of the system, where the material around the star was densest.

Here I report a study designed to examine their contention, finding results that show no dependence on the number of particles over the range usually employed up to that advocated by these authors.

However, the mechanism responsible for the attenuation is still not well-known. Aims. Thermal conduction, optically thin or thick radiation and heating are taken into account in the energy equation, and their role on the attenuation of prominence oscillations is evaluated. Methods. The dispersion relation for linear non-adiabatic magnetoacoustic waves is derived considering an equilibrium made of a prominence plasma slab embedded in an unbounded corona. The magnetic field is orientated along the direction parallel to the slab axis and has the same strength in all regions. By solving the dispersion relation for a fixed wavenumber, a complex oscillatory frequency is obtained, and the period and the damping time are computed. Results. The effect of conduction and radiation losses is different for each magnetoacoustic mode and depends on the wavenumber. In the observed range of wavelengths the internal slow mode is attenuated by radiation from the prominence plasma, the fast mode by the combination of prominence radiation and coronal conduction and the external slow mode by coronal conduction.

We will look at how heat moves, how light travels, and how heating happens to see if these things affect how fast the prominences slow down.\n\nMethods: We made a model of a prominence that is a slab of hot gas called plasma. This slab is floating in a larger area called the corona. The magnetic field is parallel to the axis of the slab and is the same strength everywhere. We used a special equation to describe how sound waves move in this model. We then solved this equation to find out how fast the waves move and how long it takes for them to slow down.\n\nResults: We found that different types of sound waves in the prominences slow down for different reasons.

      "original_text": "Clustering techniques create hierarchal network structures, called clusters, on an otherwise flat network. In a dynamic environment-in terms of node mobility as well as in terms of steadily changing device parameters-the clusterhead election process has to be re-invoked according to a suitable update policy. Cluster re-organization causes additional message exchanges and computational complexity and it execution has to be optimized. Our investigations focus on the problem of minimizing clusterhead re-elections by considering stability criteria. These criteria are based on topological characteristics as well as on device parameters. This paper presents a weighted clustering algorithm optimized to avoid needless clusterhead re-elections for stable clusters in mobile ad-hoc networks. The proposed localized algorithm deals with mobility, but does not require geographical, speed or distances information.",

To make it simpler, we created a system that helps us decide when to reorganize the groups. This system focuses on the movement and behavior of the people.",

In both doped flames, 2.49% of C3H4 was added, corresponding to a ratio C3H4/CH4 of 12% and an equivalence ratio of 1.55. The three flames have been stabilized on a burner at a pressure of 6.7 kPa using argon as dilutant, with a gas velocity at the burner of 36 cm/s at 333 K.
